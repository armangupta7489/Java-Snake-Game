**Snake Game** is a classic arcade-style game built using **Core Java (Swing & AWT)**. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer while avoiding collisions with walls or itself. The game demonstrates fundamental **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and **GUI development** using Java.
